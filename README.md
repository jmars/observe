> A Partial Object.observe Polyfill.

Observe is a very minimal and incomplete (intentionally) Object.observe polyfill, it does not detect any new keys after observation. If all you want is
to see when a key has been changed and when it was deleted, this does it. It uses native Object.observe if it is available
